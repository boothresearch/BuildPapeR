## Abstract

In this paper we look at the deterministic influence of height on annual earnings. It is well known that taller people make better researchers and thus are likely to be paid more. We take this anecdotal evidence and run a randomized regression of height on earnings while also accounting for gender identification. Since gender identification likely has a correlation with height as well, we control for interaction effects. The results are conclusive and will likely change the way we think about research in a deterministic world.

## Results

The following chart shows a regression of earnings on height and gender identification with an interaction term between height and gender identification.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(earn.nonzero$z_height, log(earn.nonzero$earn), xlab = "z-standardized height", ylab = "log earnings")
abline(a = model.coefs[1], model.coefs[2], col = "red")
abline(a = model.coefs[1] + model.coefs[3], b = model.coefs[2] + model.coefs[4], col = "blue")
```
